An edge $(u,v)$ is *undirected* if the pair $(u,v)$ is not ordered. Note that, for undirected case, $(u,v)=(v,u)$.\n",

Two vertices $u$ and $v$ are **adjacent** if there is an edge whose end vertices are $u$ and $v$. An edge is **incident** to a vertex if the vertex is one of the edge's endpoints. The **outgoing edges** of a vertex are the directed edges whose origin is that vertex. The **incoming** edges of a vertex are the directed edges whose destination is that vertex. The **degree** of a vertex $v$, denoted as $deg(v)$, is the number of incident edges of $v$. The **in-degree** and **out-degree** of a vertex $v$ are the number of the incoming and outgoing edges of $v$, and are denoted as $indeg(v)$ and $outdeg(v)$, respectively.\n",

A path is **simple** if each vertex in the path is distinct, and a cycle is **simple** if each vertex in the cycle is distinct except for the first and last one. A **directed path** is a path such that all edges are directed and are traversed along their direction. A **directed cycle** is similarly defined.

The list $V$ is replaced by a top-level dictionary $D$ that maps each vertex $v$ to its incidence map $I(v)$; not hat all vertices can be iterated through by generating the set of keys for dictionary $D$. By using such a dicitonary $D$ to map vertices to the secondary incidence maps, the references are not necessarily maintained to those incidence maps as part of the vertex structures. Also, a vertex does not need to explicitly maintain a reference to its position in $D$, because it can be determined in $O(1)$ expected time. This greatly simplifies the implementation. However, a consequence of the deisgn is that some of the worst-case running time bounds for the graph ADT operations. This runs in $O(n+m)$ time rather than strictly $O(m)$ time, as the dictionary $D$ has $n$ keys, even if some incidence maps are empty."

The vertex $s$ is now the \"current\" vertex, called $u$. Then, the graph $G$ is tranversed by considering an (arbitrary) edge $(u,v)$ incident to the current vertex $u$. If the edge $(u,v)$ leads to a vertex $v$ that is already visited, that edge is ignored. If, on the other hand, $(u,v)$ leads to an unvisited vertex $v$, then the string $s$ is unrolled and goes to $v$. Then, vertex $v$ is painted as \"visited\", and made as the current vertex, repeating the computation above. Eventually, a \"dead end\" is reached, that is, a current vertex $v$ such that all the edges incident to $v$ lead to vertices already visited. To get out of this impasse, the string $s$ is rolled back up, bakctracking along the edge that brought to $v$, going back to a previously visited vertex $u$. Then make $u$ as the current vertex and repeat the computation above for any edges incident to $u$ that have not been considered yet. If all of $u$'s incident edges lead to visited vertices, then the string is rolled up again with backtracking to the vertex where it reaches to $u$ and then repeat the procedure at that vertex. Thus, the path continues to be backtracked along until a vertex is found that has yet unexplored edges, then one such edge is taken and the traversal is continued. The process terminates when the backtracking leads back to the start vertex $s$, and there are no more unexplored edges incident to $s$."

In each iteration, the next vertex chosen is the vertex outside the cloud that is closest to $s$.
