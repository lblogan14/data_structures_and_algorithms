        "1. **Divide**: If $S$ has zero or one element, return $S$ immediately; it is already sorted. Otherwise ($S$ has at least two elements), remove all the elements from $S$ and put them into two sequences, $S_1$ and $S_2$, each containing about half of the element of $S$; that is, $S_1$ contains the first $\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$ elements of $S$, and $S_2$ contains the remaining $\\lceil n/2\\rceil$ elements.\n",
        "2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort sequences $S_1$ and $S_2$.\n",

        "\n",
        "The execution of the merge-sort algorithm can be visualized by means of a binary tree $T$, called the **merge-sort tree**. Each node of $T$ represents a recursive invocation (or call) of the merge-sort algorithm. Each node $v$ of $T$ is associated with the sequence $S$ that is processed by the invocation associated with $v$. The children of node $v$ are associated with the recursive calls that process the subsequences $S_1$ and $S_2$ of $S$. The external nodes of $T$ are associated with individual elements of $S$, corresponding to instances of the algorithm that make no recursive calls.\n",
